The [emacs-libvterm](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm) uses escape sequences to
communicate information from the emulated shell back to emacs, and does so by modifing the
shell's prompt. [spaceship](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)
overrides the prompt with `$(spaceship::prompt)`, so a custom section is required to
integrate `emacs-libvterm`.

This plugin uses the
[spaceship-section](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-section) template.
